# Aseprite Scripts
This is a collection of scripts availble for use with [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite). The collection will grow when I get more ideas for creating the scripts.

# Wiki
I have also made a [wiki page](https://github.com/haloflooder/Aseprite-Scripts/wiki) that shows some documentation about some of the scripts in the collection. It also contains some documentation about what I have discovered about Aseprite's current scripting ability, limitations, and bugs.
